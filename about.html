		<h2>ABOUT US</h2>
		<p>Welcome to the Clown School! We are a community of passionate individuals dedicated to the art of clowning.
			Our school was founded in 2005 by the legendary clown, Chuckles the Magnificent. Chuckles spent his entire
			life
			entertaining audiences all over the world with his unique brand of humor and joy. Before his passing,
			Chuckles
			wanted to pass on his knowledge and love of clowning to future generations, and thus, the Clown School was
			born.<br>At our school, we believe that laughter is the best medicine, and that clowning is a powerful tool
			for
			spreading joy and positivity. Our faculty is comprised of professional clowns with decades of experience,
			who
			are dedicated to sharing their knowledge and skills with our students.<br>We pride ourselves on providing a
			safe
			and inclusive environment for all of our students, regardless of age, race, gender, or experience level. Our
			goal is to help each student discover their own unique clown persona and style, and to empower them to share
			their talents with the world.<br>Here at the Clown School, we believe that clowning is not just about making
			people laugh. It's also about connecting with others, spreading happiness, and creating memorable
			experiences.
			We take our mission very seriously, and we are proud to have produced some of the most talented and beloved
			clowns in the world.
			Thank you for considering the Clown School for your clowning education. We look forward to sharing our
			passion
			for the art of clowning with you!</p>
